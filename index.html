    <h2>Role: UX Manager</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        As a UX Manager at Amazon, Iâ€™ve had the privilege of remotely hiring and building a high-performing team of exceptionally talented designers. I discovered a deep passion for coaching by fostering trust through empathy and encouraging authenticity across the team.

      <div>
        <p>
          <b>Overview</b>
          <br>
          In an effort to bring Dice.com into the current competitive landscape, we knew that we needed a design revolution. Dice needed to go under the microscope from the ground up.
          As a studio, we needed to work to convince senior executives and leadership that an investment into the visual language Dice represented was critical to our success. 
          We undertook the enormous effort of completely re-envisioning what it meant to be a technologist today and how users perceive the potential we can provide to help
          enable them to find the best possible careers in technology. We accomplished this through great collaboration, appealing emotionally to users and creating an
          engaging and memorable experience on Dice. This is the result of that redesign effort.

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This project involved working very closely with UX research to incorporate user feedback from user testing, interviews, and heuristic evaluations
        in order to build a responsive home page that catered to three different personas through a content-driven CMS framework. The Content Consumer, Job Seeker, and Unknown User. Based on user's interactions,
        the page alters the content to show more relevant information at the top. I defined the style guide and worked closely with Project Managers, Stakeholders,
        and Marketing, designing wireframes, prototypes, and visual design that resulted in a home page that is accessible on any platform and engaged users according to their specific needs and interests.

        </ul>
        <p>
          The eFinancialCareers iOS app went through a number of iterations, user testing, stakeholder interviews, wireframes and flows before launching the final redesign. The UI
          was greatly simplified to provide a clean, simple user experience that adhered well to Apple HIG Standards while also clearly representing the eFinancialCareers brand
          and focusing on the core functionality and needs of job seekers in the Finance Industry.

      <p>
        I worked closely with iOS and Android developers to build the first mobile app for ShopAtHome.com, from the initial concept through final product on iTunes and Google Play app stores. An intimate knowledge of
        the Apple HIG and Android Design Guidelines was necessary to adhere to user-centered design patterns for both platforms. Initial concepts, wireframes, and flowmaps were created to chart the user experience
        through the app and provide a simple, clean, usable interface that was forgiving and intuitive.
