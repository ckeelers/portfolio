    As a Sr. UX Manager and Designer with over 10 years of experience in UX, UI, and front-end web design, I have been fortunate to have the opportunity 
    to work with tight-nit teams in very fast paced, agile environments where changing priorities and fast deadlines have all 
    been the norm. I am passionate about creating experiences people love, and telling a compelling story that brings features to life. The experience should 
    be memorable and empathetic to their needs, ultimately making a lasting and positive impact on their lives.

      <p>
        Likely the most exciting and rewarding role I have had is that of UX Manager. I have a passion for leading teams. I believe my role is about nurturing, helping the individuals who report to me grow in their careers. It's about creating mechanisms that allow
        everyone on the team to have a voice in how we conduct our work, approaching them with authenticity and being willing to listen. It's about helping unblock them when there are opposing opinions or headwinds
        that require them to make high-judgement decisions. It's about caring for them as people and ensuring the work they do inches them closer to creating outcomes that improve people's lives.

      <h2>New Visual Design Language - Dice Modern</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          <b>Overview</b>
          <br>
          In an effort to bring Dice.com into the current competitive landscape, we knew that we needed a design revolution. Dice needed to go under the microscope from the ground up.
          As a studio, we needed to work to convince senior executives and leadership that an investment into the visual language Dice represented was critical to our success. 
          We undertook the enormous effort of completely re-envisioning what it meant to be a technologist today and how users perceive the potential we can provide to help
          enable them to find the best possible careers in technology. We accomplished this through great collaboration, appealing emotionally to users and creating an
          engaging and memorable experience on Dice. This is the result of that redesign effort.

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This project involved working very closely with UX research to incorporate user feedback from user testing, interviews, and heuristic evaluations
        in order to build a responsive home page that catered to three different personas through a content-driven CMS framework. The Content Consumer, Job Seeker, and Unknown User. Based on user's interactions,
        the page alters the content to show more relevant information at the top. I defined the style guide and worked closely with Project Managers, Stakeholders,
        and Marketing, designing wireframes, prototypes, and visual design that resulted in a home page that is accessible on any platform and engaged users according to their specific needs and interests.

        </ul>
        <p>
          The eFinancialCareers iOS app went through a number of iterations, user testing, stakeholder interviews, wireframes and flows before launching the final redesign. The UI
          was greatly simplified to provide a clean, simple user experience that adhered well to Apple HIG Standards while also clearly representing the eFinancialCareers brand
          and focusing on the core functionality and needs of job seekers in the Finance Industry.

        Spearheaded the planning and coordination of responsive implementation including an entire site redesign. Bootstrap was chosen as the front-end framework in an effort to expedite the process. The home page,
        store page, and grocery page, as well as the header/primary navigation are just several examples of work I designed and developed.

      <p>
        I worked closely with iOS and Android developers to build the first mobile app for ShopAtHome.com, from the initial concept through final product on iTunes and Google Play app stores. An intimate knowledge of
        the Apple HIG and Android Design Guidelines was necessary to adhere to user-centered design patterns for both platforms. Initial concepts, wireframes, and flowmaps were created to chart the user experience
        through the app and provide a simple, clean, usable interface that was forgiving and intuitive.
